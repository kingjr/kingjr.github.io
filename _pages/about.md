I am a cognitive neuroscientist working at Ecole Normale Superieure (LSP/DEC/PSL) as a CNRS researcher.

My research group focuses on the computational bases of human intelligence using machine learning for modeling and neuroimaging.

Bio
===
I did my PhD with [L. Naccache](https://icm-institute.org/en/team/team-bartolomeo-cohen-naccache/) and [S. Dehaene](http://www.unicog.org/) on diagnosing the state of consciousness of post-comatose patients from their brain activity, and a postdoc at NYU and FIAS with [D. Poeppel](https://wp.nyu.edu/poeppellab/) and [L. Melloni](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/the-institute/people/lucia-melloni-en.html) on language and perception. I then joined [Facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com/) as a research scientist.

In my spare time, I am also a core developer of [MNE](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html), an open-source library in Python to analyze time-resolved neural signals.
