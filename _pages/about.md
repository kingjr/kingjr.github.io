Research
========

My research group focuses on computational bases of human intelligence using a combination of machine learning and neuroimaging.

Bio
===
I am currently a cognitive neuroscientist working at Ecole Normale Superieure (LSP/DEC/PSL) as a CNRS researcher.

Before this, I did my PhD with [L. Naccache](https://icm-institute.org/en/team/team-bartolomeo-cohen-naccache/) and [S. Dehaene](http://www.unicog.org/) on automatic diagnosing of post-comatose patients from brain recordings, and a postdoc at NYU and FIAS with [D. Poeppel](https://wp.nyu.edu/poeppellab/) and [L. Melloni](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/the-institute/people/lucia-melloni-en.html). I then joined [Facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com/) as a research scientist.

In my spare time, I am also a core developer of MNE, an open-source library in Python to analyze time-resolved neural signals.
